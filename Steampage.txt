[h2][b]-= LEARN =-[/b][/h2]


Everything in a computer can be constructed from a basic component called a NAND gate. You will be challenged through a series of puzzles, to discover the path from NAND gates to arithmetic, memory and all the way to full CPU architectures. If you complete this game, you will have a deep understanding of how assembly, CPU instruction sets and basic components are related. And you will understand how programming concepts like if statements, loops and functions actually work in assembly and hardware.

[h2][b]-= BUILD =-[/b][/h2]


The game is built on a powerful simulator, that gives you total freedom in how you solve levels or create your own computers. Wire up screens, timers, sound, keyboard input and network components to create whatever you want. You can even design a unique assembly language for your computer.

-----

Learn CPU architecture with puzzles

A humble start
with nothing given

Create every component yourself

Build more complex circuits

Eventually complete 
your first computer

Programming in binary
is a pain...

So you make an assembly language

Who says you can't solve mazes
in 20 bytes?

In your own assembly language

On your own computer

Optimize your solutions

Or build anything you want

"If you try to make such projects, unseen by others,
as perfect as any human could, you'll develop
skills that other professionals don't have"
