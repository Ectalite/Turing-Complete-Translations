=== trans/manual_text_ram ===

$10969790213397*
This simulator has several types of RAM different trade-offs, similar to real life RAM options.

[b]RAM[/b]
The RAM component can store a lot of data, but adds a very high delay to the circuit.

[b]Fast RAM[/b]
The fast RAM has a low delay, but a very high gate cost per byte.

[b]Latency RAM[/b]
The normal RAM has very high delay, however instead of waiting for this delay each tick, we can treat the RAM as if load and save takes multiple ticks. The number of ticks save and load will take depends on the length of each tick. Say for example that our circuit has a delay of 100 units, a load would take 10 ticks, since we have to wait about 1000 units of delay. 

A common approach for pipelined architectures is to use Latency RAM as for main memory, but use a small amount of Fast RAM for caching. Since memory access is often adjacent or close (for example when looping over an array), fetching adjacent values when loading from Latency RAM and caching them in Fast RAM can significantly speed up certain kinds of programs.

The simplest way to integrate the Latency RAM is simply to stall the whole architecture while waiting for a save or load. An easy optimization on this comes from realizing that you don't have to wait for saves, except if you want to load.

[b]Dual Load RAM[/b]
Sometimes it is beneficial to separate parts of the logic into a separate processing unit, that operates more or less independently. This could be for handling a display device or a network connection. In these cases, the independent unit will often need to continuously load and save to memory, while the outside logic only needs to occasionally load. Use Dual Laod RAM to avoid having to schedule who gets access to the RAM at what time.

=== trans/manual_text_short_circuit ===

$31105471890701*
In electronics, two components outputting different values on the same wire causes a short circuit.

[center][img=100]res://dialogue/short_circuit.png[/img][/center]

However, by disconnecting output pins from a wire, it is possible for multiple pins to share the same wire (called a bus). Importantly, at most 1 component output should remain connected each tick, otherwise you risk a short circuit.

[center][img]res://dialogue/switch.png[/img][/center]

In this simulator, pins that can be disconnected are grey.

It turns out that you can build all the logic for a computer out of either NAND or NOR gates. The Apollo guidance computers, were built entirely of NOR gates. Designed in the sixties, they had only 4KB of RAM and 32KB of disk space, but guided astronauts to the moon nonetheless.

Modern computers are not built entirely of just one of the universal gates, but when applicable NAND gates are preferred over NOR, because they have less delay and occupy less area.

The program component is a read only memory component, that can have its data programmed in assembly. To edit the assembly, click on the yellow edit icon in the corner of the component.

[center][img]dialogue/manual/program_edit.png[/img][/center]

In the middle of the screen you will see the code area, read more about the assembly [color=#4d82c5][url=Assembly]here[/url][/color].

On the left hand side of the assembly editor interface, you can add assembly codes (mnemonics). Assembly codes act as a replacement for numbers, so instead of remembering what number represents the AND instruction in your architecture, you can add "AND" to your assembly codes, making code easier to read and write.

[center][img]dialogue/manual/assembly_codes.png[/img][/center]

On the program component you will also find the "Watch state" button. 

[center][img]dialogue/manual/watch_state.png[/img][/center]

This can be used to connect the assembly editor to registers, counters or probes. This way, the state of your architecture can be inspected as you write code, without closing the editor.


=== trans/manual_text_matrix ===

$75170402412137*
[b]Showing letters[/b]
It just so happens that a pixel space of 5x7 while small is still able to render letters nicely. By adding an extra row and column, these letters will also look nice when put next to each other. 

[center][img]dialogue/manual/matrix_letter.png[/img][/center]


[b]Small tileable screen[/b]
Rotating the component, you get 8x6 pixels, which has a nice 4:3 aspect ratio and tiling these, you can get most resolutions you might want. The way the pins are set up on this component was specifically designed to allow tiling. Imagine the naive pin design where each component is enabled by a single bit. This would require you to connect 1 wire for each component. In this situation, the number of wires needed for a tiled screen would scale with the area, while the gap needed to fit wires between components, would scale with the circumference. 

[center][img]dialogue/manual/tilable_screen.png[/img][/center]

Instead, by having 2 enable pins, one wire can enable a whole row and another a whole column. This way, a single component can be selected by its unique row and column combination. Further, fitting the rest of the data on the same wires, means that the horizontal and vertical gaps only need to be 1 square wide. This component visually takes up half a square extra on all sides, such that these components can be tiled up pixel perfectly, with 1 square hidden between them for running wires.

Open the component factory by clicking on this button [img]dialogue/manual/component_factory_icon.png[/img] in the upper left bar.

The component factory allows you to create your own components. The logic you place determine the behavior of the custom component and the layout determines the shape. 

The input and output components you place become pins on the component. Like with other components, a component output leading back to its input causes a circular dependency. Outputs having a path back to inputs causes a circular dependency for custom components, even if the insides of the component would suggest there shouldn't be one. Not having to worry about the inside of components reduces the complexity of larger builds, however this strict abstraction can be inconvenient under certain circumstances. In that case, use the unbuffered pins. They allow bidirectional flow and use the insides of the component to check for circular dependencies.

Probes placed in custom components will show on their layout and can display values inside. Probes can be connected to other custom components, so that deeply nested values can be displayed. Values probed in this way can also be connected to the program component.

For the component factory, the file manager also manages the custom components. The file names decide the component name and the folder structure decides the components placement in the menu.

[b]Overview[/b]
The "Network" component gives you low level access to networking. In general you manipulate your network by sending the component [color=#e49f44]Commands[/color] and when update [color=#39aa49]Events[/color] return from the network they get queued up and you process them one at a time. To keep track of different simultaneous connections [color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color]s are used.

These are the command types you can send to the component and their arguments:
[code]0[/code] No command
[code]1[/code] [color=#e49f44]Listen[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Port[/color])
[code]2[/code] [color=#e49f44]Connect[/color] ([color=#dd6576]IP[/color], [color=#dd6576]Port[/color])
[code]3[/code] [color=#e49f44]Send data[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color], [color=#dd6576]Data[/color], [color=#dd6576]Data length[/color])
[code]4[/code] [color=#e49f44]Close[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color])
[code]5[/code] [color=#e49f44]Read next event[/color]
[i]See component panel for which pin correspond to which argument.[/i]

Command types [color=#e49f44]Listen[/color] and [color=#e49f44]Connect[/color] outputs the [color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color] of the new connection.

For 2 programs to [color=#e49f44]Send data[/color] to each other, one program must first [color=#e49f44]Listen[/color] (called a server) on a [color=#dd6576]Port[/color] and the other must then [color=#e49f44]Connect[/color] (called a client), using the [color=#dd6576]IP[/color] of the listening program and the [color=#dd6576]Port[/color] it selected. Once the connection is established, the server and client function exactly the same.

Notice an [color=#dd6576]IP[/color] is a 32 bit number, normally written as 4 bytes with dots in between (example: 127.0.0.1). In this simulator you reverse the order of the bytes, so 127.0.0.1 becomes 0x0100007F. 0x0100007F is always your computers loopback address and you can use this to connect programs running on the same computer.

You can detect when events happen on the network, by checking the "Next event type" pin. These are the event types:
[code]0[/code] No event
[code]1[/code] [color=#39aa49]Incoming connection[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color], [color=#dd6576]Port[/color])
[code]2[/code] [color=#39aa49]Connect complete[/color]
[code]3[/code] [color=#39aa49]Receive data[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Connection ID, Data[/color], [color=#dd6576]Data length[/color])
[code]4[/code] [color=#39aa49]Connection closed[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color] / [color=#dd6576]Error code[/color])

[color=#39aa49]Incoming connection[/color] only happens after a [color=#e49f44]Listen[/color]. Use the [color=#dd6576]Port[/color] to distinguish between listeners (it is not possible to listen to the same port twice at the same time).

[color=#39aa49]Connect complete[/color] only happens after a [color=#e49f44]Connect[/color], wait for this before you start sending data.

You may send or receive between 1 and 8 bytes of data at a time, use the [color=#dd6576]Data length[/color] to decide.

A connection may be either "possibly open" or "closed". There is no way to know if a connection is actually open other than sending data. The underlying network protocols were designed like this for reliability and speed, it is not a limitation of the simulator.

If you get a [color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color] of -1, this means there was an error connecting.
