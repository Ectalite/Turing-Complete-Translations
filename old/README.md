# What is this?
This is a place for community translations of the game Turing Complete.

# How can I add translations?
Translation files live in the sub directory of the game called "translations". You can find the directory on your computer by right clicking the game on steam:

![Finding the path](https://turingcomplete.game/github_translations/local_path.png?)

In this directory you will find .txt files named by language code. If you want to add a new language, copy paste the en.txt file and rename it here. In the files you will see IDs that start with $ (like $18945946395447). These are used to identify different text in the game. The text next to them or on the line below is what will be used for translation.

To load a translation file open the game and in the main menu hit the \` key to open the console. Then type `language ru` or whatever the language code of your .txt file is. Note that some text is only translated when the game starts.

If you want to translate something that doesn't have IDs yet, ask me on the translators channel on discord: https://discord.gg/hdrJaMUdrF
